Tic Tac Toe Game 

A program to create a classic Tic Tac Toe game. Two players take turns
marking Xs and Os on a 3î‚Ÿ3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks
either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. 
The board is printed after each move, with colored marks to distinguish between
the players. The game checks for a winner after each move and ends when a
player wins or when the board is full, resulting in a draw.
