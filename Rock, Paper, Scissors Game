Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

The game will prompt the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors by typing 'r',
'p', or 's'. The computer will randomly select its choice. The game will then display
both choices using emojis and determine the winner based on the rules. 


import random
seq = ('r', 'p', 's')
random.choice(seq)

mapping = {
    'r':'ðŸŒš',
    'p': 'ðŸ“°',
    's': 'âœ‚'
}
win = True
while win == True:
    x = input('Rock, paper or scissors? (r/p/s): ')
    print(f'You chose {mapping.get(x)}')
    y = random.choice(seq)
    print(f'Computer chose {mapping.get(y)}')
    if x == y:
        print('Game Draw')
    elif x == 'r' and y == 'p':
        print('You loose')
        win = False
    elif x == 's' and y == 'p':
        print('You won')
    elif x == 'r' and y =='s':
        print('You won')
    else:
        print('You loose')
        win = False
